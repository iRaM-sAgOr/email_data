This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much 
negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the  original scope 
proposed by AEP.  Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any 
solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our 
limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months.  There are 
many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation 
between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the 
risks and rewards of ""stepping too close to or over the line"".

Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only 
applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if 
there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian

"Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing. 
 I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices 
 (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  
 I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which
 I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. 
 Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to 
 have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors

Sanjay: Some information of possible interest to you. I attended a meeting 
this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups 
promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming 
WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week 
and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee

This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him

After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other

"Following up on last night's e-mail, here are some specific suggestions to strengthen the draft EPSA letter on the Barton RTO draft.

The second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by ""technical corrections"" as the draft letter now states:

You have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a well-functioning transmission system, and we wholeheartedly agree.

Diane and let her know.  I assume Jeff and Ken and Pug will get a chance to

In the second paragraph we should delete the ""partnership"" statement.  I 
think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management 
capabilities (as provided by Enron, if necessary).  That's the basis for the 
ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale).  I am also concerned 
that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the 
commodity price guarantees.

I realize you have pushed these guys already, but the attached letter would 
be better if not sent at all.  It doesn't address the real underlying problem 
-- that a ""reliability bill"" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem.  
Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a 
political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for 
action next year.  If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go

Subject:	Enron Expatriates in India

Steve,


I wanted to give you the latest figures on Enron expatriates in India. 
 There are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by six dependants.
  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.
  The total of 40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows: 
 21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By company, they are broken down as follows:  
Enron India -  eight plus three dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; 
EBS - one plus two dependants; DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine. 
 These figures are likely to continue to trend downward; 
Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.


We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates
 in the event of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, 
although a large-scale evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon season has started. 
 A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the
 evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources.

As you know, 
Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there.

were angry. He even had kind words for Gov. Gray Davis, who, he said, "was dealt a very difficult hand." 
Skilling became Enron's chief executive in February, replacing company founder Kenneth Lay, an early proponent of electricity deregulation who is close to President Bush. 
Enron, a global energy giant with roots in the natural gas industry, owns some power plants, but its influence in the electricity industry reflects the rapid growth of its energy trading operation. 
Enron's only California generators are small wind facilities. However, the company has developed power plants. Enron initiated two 750-megawatt projects that were sold to Calpine Corp., including a Pittsburg plant due to go online next month. Enron has announced plans to seek regulators' approval for a 750-megawatt power plant in Roseville in Placer County. 
During the first three months of 2001, Enron posted a huge jump in revenue, to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion a year ago, but a much smaller gain in net income, to $425 million from $338 million. Skilling himself cashed an $850,000 paycheck and got a $5.6 million bonus last year. 
But the energy crisis has taken its toll on Enron's stock price and on Skilling, who owned or held options to buy 1.9 million shares of Enron common stock at the time of the company's February proxy filing. At Thursday's closing price of $44.05 a share, the stock was down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of $90.75 in August. 
That proved that Enron wasn't the villain in California, Skilling said. "This thing in California has been bad for everybody," he said. "If we had anything to do with this, we're the stupidest people in the world."

being passed to Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen email addresses.

A secured folder has been set up on the "o" drive under Corporate called Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).

If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/. 
 Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

According to a number of computer security types, a purported

RECKONINGS

True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages
even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable
competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that
market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring
billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the
generators.

32.
First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

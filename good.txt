Thanks for taking time to call  yesterday.  Good luck with the Lockyer situ=
ation.  I truly do believe  that direct and prompt interaction with Lockyer=
 will prove more effective for  Enron than delayed or intermediated action.=
    As we discussed,  if I can be of any help with reconnaissance or as sou=

I have attached an article from  this morning's LA Times.  It provides an C=

Here it is!

Plenty of good Houston input here as well as Europe.

An excellent general article has resulted; nice pictures too.  I'll get some 
original copies couriered over to you asap.

We are organising bi-lingual reprints.  Please let Iona know how many you'd 
like.

Thanks

4.
Jim- Do you have a list of who I talked to in Houston and their affiliation.
 I would like to keep straight who I have spoken with. 
 The only card I received is from Michael Geffroy.
 Let me know if there is a problem with this request. Thanks, Rick Buy
5.
Once the website is functional, it will be helpful to have a complete history 
of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process. 

One final thought, Michael is quite supportive of our effort and I think we 
should pick battles carefully. Rick

To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities,
 Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding 
 Confidential Information and Securities Trading ("Policies and Procedures").
 These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom,
 and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, 
 the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, 
 so that the role of the "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.
 You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures.
 The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, 
 the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department.  
 Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp 
7.
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year,
 you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become 
 familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures.  
 If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year,
 then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message. 
 The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number.
 If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extension 3-1939.

Many Linux vendors have released a patch for the xinetd package
that fixes a flaw in the way the application deals with TCP
WAIT commands. The problem prevents the linuxconf-web
application from working properly. Another flaw in the xinetd
package creates world-writeable files that can be used in a
symlink attack. Linux-Mandrake users can download the new patch
from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3

Red Hat users can get more information and links to patches

Linux-Mandrake has issued a patch for its tcpdump package that
fixes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The flaw could
be used in a remote attack on the tcpdump process. This patch
also fixes a previous vulnerability that could allow a remote
user to run arbitrary code on the affected system without root
privileges. The new patch can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3

14.
According to an alert from Linux-Mandrake, several flaws have
been found in the UW-IMAP package that could allow an
authenticated user to gain greater shell command access. This
is particularly problematic for e-mail systems that do not
normally provide shell access. Patches can be downloaded from:

FYI, the following website describes a variety of econometrics methods - which we plan to implement to solve the private firm problem.  

	Many of these methods were briefly described in the recent draft of the Duffie document.  

	Kyriakos will be writing a paper which will describe these methods in more detail.

This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much 
negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the  original scope 
proposed by AEP.  Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any 
solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our 
limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months.  There are 
many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation 
between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the 
risks and rewards of "stepping too close to or over the line".

Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only 
applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if 
there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian 
Redmond and me.

19.
This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have 
any thoughts

28.

Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing. 
 I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices 
 (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  
 I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which
 I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. 
 Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to 
 have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors

Sanjay: Some information of possible interest to you. I attended a meeting 
this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups 
promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming 
WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week 
and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee 
looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was 
among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have 
an interest.
37.
Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her 
the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send 
her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. 
One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of 
these items to Delhi.
38.

I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I 
distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to 
Sudaker today.

Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in 
this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to 
have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.

Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get 
something done in October.
Joe
39.
This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him 
about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. 
After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other 
companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy 
services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them 
in India and possibly abroad.

I've been meaing to ask you about the paper I sent to Sam on calculating implied pdf's for futures prices. Sam told me that you didn't want to include it in RI because it and the EOL article gave too much away.  I've talked with several folks about the approach outlined in the paper.  I've reworked the paper to try and better tailor it to traders, and I'd be interested in your feedback.

However, I hope I have more time to double check this.

I'll do the proofreadding, and send this again,
after the presentation tomorrow, 
together with the summary report of tomorrow's presentation.    

I am sorry for this again.

OK, here's the working draft "masterpiece" (haha).   Please review and provide comments and feedback by the end of the week (note: Ted and David, we have a conference call scheduled Wednesday for the three of us to discuss).   Also, I'm sending to Price Waterhouse Coopers for their input as well - I need to spend more time reviewing what they sent on Friday to see if I've missed any issues we want to address.

I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to "cushion" the reception. 

Review meetings with these functions begins tomorrow (Tuesday), when I meet with
70
I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).  I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.  


Thanks for your help,

Take care and hope to meet you in Houston.

I agree.  I am almost through it -- and while there are improvements per our suggestions from the first draft -- 
there are both substantive and format problems -- i.e., it does not read very well in places, aside from substance. 
 Will fax Amr my comments on the text and leave with DC colleagues as I will be up in the Senate on RTOs this afternoon.
76.
In the context of GNIE Project and the papers that shall be put forward to the participants,
 I am seeking your help in providing comments on paper one in the list below. 
 I can not recommend it in its current form since it departs from Enron's line of thinking in many places.  
 There is a tendency to make these papers neutral, but I found it actually going the other direction.

Kindly advise of your point of view.  It is time sensitve, and I appreciate your help

I think the presentation looks good.  In the meeting itself I think you 
should go heavy on the argument that it makes no sense for Sempra 
shareholders to be in a commodity market as a regulated entity -- the "heads 
they win tails you lose" argument.
82.
Looks good.  I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it 
more explicit:

The continued growth of the new economy is not growing by our electricity 
infrastructure more than anything else.
The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and 
pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach.
Let's start getting the word out!

I'll do the proofreadding, and send this again,
after the presentation tomorrow, 
together with the summary report of tomorrow's presentation.  
98.

I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).  I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.

Attached is my trip report for Amsterdam, Paris and London - I've given the 
contact information for everyone to Kathy to be entered in the database and 
thank you notes are going out today.

Terry asked me to email these attachments to each of you.  One is an 
organizational chart for his department and
the other is a Global Affairs Activities Matrix.

The attached release announcing Enron Communications' investment in Avici and 
our addition of their routers to our network is scheduled to be issued on 
Thursday.  As background, ECI has invested $5 million in Avici.

If you have any comments or questions, please let me know by 10 a.m. 
Thursday.
102
attached in the document are the next four descriptions.  Only 3 o/s now ont 
he liquids markets.  I will try to get these to you today as well.

103
I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.
104
Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read
105
I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective 
Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with 
the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?
106
You missed logistics as a rotaion.

Also - Let's leave out where they graduate to.  This might be an issue with 
the AA program if we say that they are going to re-enter the program.
107.

I've finished marking up the drafts, and thought perhaps a few thoughts would 
give you some insight into the reasons for my revisions .
108
I know that scheduling this meeting may be difficult for some and that
schedules are already full, but schedules will become even more
difficult later in the month.  I take as our deadline having new
language for the Hill during the August recess.

Thank you in advance for your continuing efforts to bring this new model
for reliability into existence.

I sent the following to Andy Black in order to ensure that we also discuss
the RTO/market power issues.  I'll bring copies to the meeting.  Please feel
free to take issue with the language.

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoon's discussion.
As I mentioned, I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO.  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper.  For that reason, I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors (at least my view) of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I.
